# 3D-FORMS
In this Project I have made a 3d form .
I made this using html , css and javascript.
Used HTML for the structure of  page and then styled it using CSS and after that I done some Javascript for it , so that you can get alert and the form will be in sign up and sign in mode
If you click on sign in button you will get redirected towards the signin form.
And if you click on sign up button you'll get redirected towards the sign up form.
And if you misses out to fill anything in the form It will show an alert that "You have to fill the fporm correctly!".
And if you have filled all the things correctly , you will get an alert that "You have signed up / signed in successfully!"
